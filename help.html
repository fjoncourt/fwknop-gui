 Welcome to fwknop-gui! This app is for the sending of SPA Packets to a Linux host or router, mainly
 for opening ports in an iptables firewall. More info
 <a href="https://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/">at the Cipherdyne web site</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Get started by selecting "New Config" from the menu, and then filling in at least "Nickname", "Server Address",
 and "Rijndael Key." It is also recommended to set an "HMAC Key" as well for strong authentication of SPA packets.
  </p>
 <p>
  Once the data is filled in, select "Save Config" from the menu. Then, to send a SPA knock, select the
   Saved config you want to use, and click the "Send Knock" button at the bottom of the list.
